## Set up:
1. Clone this repo to your machine
2. `cd` into the repo's root directory
3. Run `npm install`

## How to Run The Tests

The `dog` tests are already passing. You can check by running:

```
npm test src/dog-test.js
```

Familiarize yourself with the existing code. Then, start passing the `person` tests:

```
npm test src/person-test.js
```
